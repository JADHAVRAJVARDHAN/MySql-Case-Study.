# 🚀 SQL Case Study: Sales & Profit Analytics

As part of my hands-on practice with SQL, I worked on a comprehensive **Sales and Marketing Analytics case study** using three relational datasets to draw business insights for a fictional retail company. This exercise involved real-world use cases such as identifying top-performing products, analyzing marketing spends, and comparing profits across states.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

As a database analyst, my objective was to explore sales and profitability data across different states, products, and time periods. The goal was to extract actionable insights from sample customer data related to:

* Sales trends 📈
* Profit margins 💰
* Marketing expenditure 📣
* Inventory and budget analysis 📊

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

Here are the three datasets I worked with:

| Table Name        | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FactTable**     | 4200 rows of metrics: `Date`, `ProductID`, `Profit`, `Sales`, `Marketing`, etc. |
| **ProductTable**  | 13 rows: maps `ProductID` to `Product`, `Type`, and `Product Type`.             |
| **LocationTable** | 156 rows: maps `Area Code` to `State`, `Market`, and `Market Size`.             |
